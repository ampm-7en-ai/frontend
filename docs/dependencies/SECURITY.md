## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Dependency Security Checklist

#### Before Adding New Dependencies
- [ ] Check package popularity (npm weekly downloads > 10k)
- [ ] Verify active maintenance (last update < 6 months)
- [ ] Review open security issues on GitHub
- [ ] Check license compatibility
- [ ] Scan with `npm audit` after installation
- [ ] Verify package author reputation
- [ ] Review package permissions/access

#### During Development
- [ ] Run `npm audit` before commits
- [ ] Review Dependabot PRs within 48h
- [ ] Never commit `node_modules/` to git
- [ ] Use exact versions for Docker/production builds
- [ ] Enable 2FA on npm account
- [ ] Regularly update development dependencies

#### Before Deployment
- [ ] Run full security scan (`npm audit --production`)
- [ ] Review all high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test patches in staging environment
- [ ] Document any accepted risks
- [ ] Update security report

```

### Patching Process

#### 1. Assessment Phase
```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit

# Check for available patches
npm audit fix --dry-run

# Review impact
npm ls <vulnerable-package>
```

#### 2. Testing Phase
```bash
# Apply patches in development
npm audit fix

# Run test suite
npm run test

# Test in staging
npm run build
# Deploy to staging environment
```

#### 3. Deployment Phase
```bash
# Create patch branch
git checkout -b security-patch-YYYY-MM-DD

# Commit changes
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "security: patch vulnerabilities (CVE-XXXX-XXXX)"

# Deploy via CI/CD pipeline
git push origin security-patch-YYYY-MM-DD
```

## 📋 Known Issues & Accepted Risks

### Currently Accepted Risks
**None** - All identified vulnerabilities have been patched.

### Monitoring Watchlist
The following packages are being monitored for potential security concerns:

| Package | Reason | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|
| `sse.js` | Limited maintenance | Low | Monitoring for alternatives |
| - | - | - | - |

---

## 🔒 Security Configuration

### npm Configuration
```bash
# .npmrc (recommended settings)
audit=true
audit-level=moderate
save-exact=false  # Allow semver for security patches
```

### Package Lock
- **Strategy:** Commit `package-lock.json` to git
- **Rationale:** Ensures reproducible builds, but allows security patches
- **Update Frequency:** Weekly via Dependabot
